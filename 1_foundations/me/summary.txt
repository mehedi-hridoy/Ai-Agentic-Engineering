I’m Mehedi Hasan Hridoy, a passionate Computer Science student from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Technology isn’t just something I study — it’s the core of who I am. I live by the words “life with code and live by code.”

I’m deeply curious about how things work — from algorithms and AI to DevOps and web development. Every day, I push myself to learn, create, and improve so I can think and work like a world-class engineer. My ultimate goal is to use technology to solve real-world problems and make a global impact.

For me, coding isn’t just a skill — it’s a way to shape ideas into reality and bring change to the world, one line of code at a time.
